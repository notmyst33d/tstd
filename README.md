# tstd
Tiny stdlib

## This is horrible, dont use it.
No but really, this is beyond fucked up, this should never have seen the light of day, yet i created it because "Haha low level programming funny", so yeah, dont use it.

## """Features"""
* 100% compiler/runtime/environment independent
* x64 and ARM64 support(ARM64 support might be broken at the moment)
* Very compact(calc example only takes up 1.3 KB of space)
* Integer to string and string to integer conversion(dont read the code please, its an absolute mindfuck)
* Syscalls with sys_ functions
* (x64 only) CRT for `main` function with argc and argv support
* Basic `strlen` implementation
